Hey there nosy web page reader! My name is Hunter Gabbard and this is my web page containing a list of publications, talks I've given around the world, my CV and hopefully ... eventually ... some of my own blog post musings on gravitational waves, machine learning and cosmology. At some point I'd also like to add a few of my own data analysis tutorials. We'll see how much time I'm able to get. 

I'm a physics and astronomy PhD student at the University of Glasgow with deep (pardon the pun) interests in machine learning and statistics. I also want to move into dark matter, dark energy and cosmology at some point over the next several years. In my free time I enjoy backpacking, camping, (poor) acoustic guitar playing, baking, reading and video games. I also have a fond affinity for Scotch whiskies, particularly Islay whiskies.

I was born in the great state of Texas and moved up to Chicago at the age of 1. During my childhood I was heavily involved in many of sports (football, figure skating, soccer) until my family moved back down to Austin. I continued playing football in high school, took up pole vaulting and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. I decided early on that I wanted to go to university out of state and settled on the University of Mississippi to pursue a degree in physics. It was at Ole Miss that I found my true passion for physics and machine learning. While at Ole Miss I worked under the tutelage of Marco Cavaglia on detector characterization for advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory). I spent many countless hours hunched over my laptop searching for all sorts of glitches which go bump in the night. 

I was fortunate enough to be awarded two summer fellowships through the National Science Foundation at both the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Brownsville, Texas and the Laboratoire de l'Accélérateur Linéaire in Paris, France. In Paris, I worked with Florence Robinet on the characterization and improvement of the Omicron event trigger generator. In Brownsville, I had my first exposure to machine learning through the use of self organizing feature maps applied to unsupervised glitch classification. Though no manuscript came out of this fellowship, it was a formative experience for me and set my on the current path I am on now.

In 2016, I was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship from the United States Department of State for study at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Research in Hannover, Germany. Not only did I get to work with some of the best in the business during my time at the Institute, but met some amazing people along the way who I continue to be friends with to this day. If you only get one chance to experience Germany, you absolutely ... unequivocally ... have to visit the Christmas markets. You may die of meat sweats, but you won't regret it.

Now, finally, I'm here at Glasgow! I was lucky enough to be awarded the SUPA Higgs fellowship to come here and since then have primarily been working on various applications of machine learning towards the LIGO search for gravitational waves. 

In terms of future plans, I don't have a preference yet about whether I stay in academia, go into a government lab, or work in industry. As long as the work is fun and the problems are interesting, it's all gravy to me! More science related stuff to come in future blog posts.
